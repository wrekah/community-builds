      "This build is about being super annoying, damaging your enemies with E and doing damage at the same time with Mandate AND healing your allies with Font of Life.",
      "Imperial Mandate is only mandatory item for this build. Then you need to adapt to enemy team. They heavy AP? Buy MR. They heavy AD? Buy Armor. Maybe you have super carry ADC? You could buy Zeke's Convergence.",
      "Mythic item is optional for this build. Good choices, if you want to build one is: Echoes of Helia or Radiant Virtue.",
      "Do not wait for 'special moment'. You have great engaging tool with E. Use it to catch people.",
      "You can play as peeler as well.",
      "Your R shreds resists. It is often recommended to use that on enemy tank. This way, you are getting more tanky and can go into fights. Or R enemy tank to burst him down quickly, when he comes at your team.",
      "You have great anti push with E. All of your team mates just died? Just place E on path of minions few times and wait.",
      "You can coordinate with your team, so they know to wait with poke abilities until you use E on enemy team. It is much easier to hit skillshots then!",
      "Great items to counter enemy team is (because interactions with E) is: Chemtech Putrifier and Serpent's Fang."

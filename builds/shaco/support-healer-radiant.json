      "This build works best, when your team drafted full damage (AGAIN) and you need both frontline and sustain in fights (note: use a normal tank/dmg build, when you have insane bruiser-healing such as Mundo/Olaf/Fiora/Soraka/Vlad).",
      "You won't be most tanky with this build, however you have tools to survive long enough to soak damage and disrupt fights.",
      "Engage with snowball, stay around enemies for a bit to disrupt and soak damage, use ult (Radiant Virtue procs on clone as well). Use Q to get out if you are low. Otherwise use Q to reposition and annoy enemy backline. Heal up with Warmog's Armor if you ever get low. Rinse and repeat.",
      "Rush first Radiant Virtue, second Redemption.",
      "Use Redemption as often as possible to (mostly) heal your allies.",
      "Your E heals! It triggers Font of Life for your allies. Both passive and active part. So, it sometimes makes sense to not E at all, and just auto attack for more healing.",
      "Your W and your R also heals!",
      "Adapt to enemy team. They heavy AP? Buy MR. They heavy AD? Buy Armor."

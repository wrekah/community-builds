    "description": "Support Jarvan IV build for ARAM with Moonstone Renewer.",
    "how it works": [
      "You support your Team providing Healing, Shielding and various Buffs.",
      "You rush <b>Moonstone Renewer</b>.",
      "You can peel from your carries with Exhaust."
    ],
    "how to play": [
      "You need to <b>adapt</b> in the game to your team and to the enemy team.",
      "You can get <b>Mark</b> (<b>Snowball</b>) summoner instead of Exhaust if you want to play more aggressive and to go in.",
      "You will be squishy early on, and if you don't go some tanky items later. Be careful!",
      "Your team needs to engage? Get items like <b>Shurelya's Battlesong</b> or Trailblazer.",
      "Your team getting poked to death? Consider getting <b>Redemption</b> AND/OR <b>Locket of the Iron Solari</b>",
      "If you are just getting poked and cannot manage to stay alive - get <b>Kaenic Rookern</b> or <b>Warmog's Armor</b> (caution: needs enough HP!)",
      "You have tanks, bruisers and your team lack damage? As a last resort, you can buy few items to even help with that!",
      "Remember to counter an enemy team. For example, if they have lots of healing, get Executioner's Calling early."
    ],
    "how it works champion": [
      "Your <b>Demacian Standard (E)</b> triggers Summon Aery shields!",
      "You can help your team kill tanky champions by using Dragon Strike (<b>Q</b>) on them. It reduces target's armor!"
    ],
    "how to play champion": [
      "You can have 100% uptime on <b>E</b> (with some Ability Haste), meaning you will be shielding/healing/buffing your team all the time.",
      "Cast <b>E</b> near your team if you want shield/heal/buff them.",
      "<b>E</b> gives vision, so you can scout bushes.",
      "Play safe, like support for the most part and stay back. Look for opportunities to catch/engage enemies, but be careful, because you are squishy with this build.",
      "Cool combo is <b>R</b> enemies + <b>Flash</b> or <b>R</b> enemies + <b>E</b> + <b>Q</b> away.",
      "You can play Aery ping pong to maximize uptime. Just come close to whoever got it, to get it back. This way you will maximize the number of shields.",
      "If you want to shield a specific person, just cast <b>E</b> closest to them."
    ],
    "tricks champion": [
      "You can use <b>Demacian Standard (E)</b> for brush control.",
      "Remember that <b>Dragon Strike (Q)</b> reduces target's armor!",
      "Switch targets often in fights to fully use your <b>Martial Cadence (Passive)</b> for more damage!",
      "Combo #1: <b>Q</b> + <b>E</b> + <b>Flash</b>. Just <b>Q</b> + <b>E</b> and during the last frames of animation, you can <b>Flash</b> into enemy knocking them up.",
      "Combo #2: If you have enough Ability Haste, you can put <b>E</b>, wait and <b>Q</b> to it and cast second <b>E</b> hitting your target. This is especially cool with AP builds. So you can cast <b>E</b> while sliding to existing <b>E</b>."
    ],
    "tricks champion riot": [
      "You can use the Dragon Strike / Demacian Standard combo to get out of your own Cataclysm arenas.",
      "Split your basic attacks on different champions at the beginning of fights to maximize damage.",
      "Use Demacian Standard as a scouting tool when worried about incoming enemies."

    "how it works": [
      "You rush <b>Thornmail</b>.",
      "You go full Armor.",
      "<strong>Hit or miss. Works only if an enemy team is full of physical damage dealers (preferably auto-attackers).</strong>",

      "How is this <b>Thornmail</b> build for Jarvan IV different to regular tank builds? Item order, Armor stacking and countering enemy physical damage dealers!",
      "This build is aimed to counter AD comps. Since you don't know the enemy team, you need to <b>adapt</b> in game. It is hit or miss. If they are heavy AP - just play regular tank.",
      "Late game, you can consider selling boots for 6th item - for even more sweet <b>Thornmail</b> damage!",
      "Be careful to not waste Aftershock. Try timing it and keeping it for going in."

      "You can use <b>Demacian Standard (E)</b> for brush control.",

      "Combo #1: <b>Q</b> + <b>E</b> + <b>Flash</b>. Just <b>Q</b> + <b>E</b> and during the last frames of animation, you can <b>Flash</b> into enemy knocking them up.",
      "Combo #2: If you have enough Ability Haste, you can put <b>E</b>, wait and <b>Q</b> to it and cast second <b>E</b> hitting your target. This is especially cool with AP builds. So you can cast <b>E</b> while sliding to existing <b>E</b>."

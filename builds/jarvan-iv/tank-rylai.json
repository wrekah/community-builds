    "description": "Rylai's + Imperial Mandate ARAM Jarvan IV Tank build. Tank with slows, heals and AP damage.",
    "how it works": [
      "You play as a slow tank, disrupting fights and soaking damage.",
      "Thanks to slow + <b>Font of Life</b>, you heal allies. You can even get support items. ",
      "Core items: <b>Rylai's Crystal Scepter</b> + <b>Imperial Mandate</b>. If you are behind and the game not go perfectly, skip <b>Imperial Mandate</b> and go <b>full tank</b>."
    ],
    "how to play": [
      "Your all abilities slow and heal your allies and giving them <b>Imperial Mandate</b> buff.",
      "You can go some support items as well in some cases, like Arden Censer if you got a lot of auto attackers on your team.",
      "<b>Guardian's Horn</b> is a surprisingly good item for its price. You can keep it for very long time (or even have it as 6th item).",
      "Enemy team heavy on AP? Buy MR. They are heavy on AD? Buy Armor. You need some damage? Well buy that.",
      "Be careful to not waste Aftershock. Try timing it and keeping it for going in."

    "tricks champion": [
      "You can use <b>Demacian Standard (E)</b> for brush control.",
      "Remember that <b>Dragon Strike (Q)</b> reduces target's armor!",
      "Switch targets often in fights to fully use your <b>Martial Cadence (Passive)</b> for more damage!",
      "Combo #1: <b>Q</b> + <b>E</b> + <b>Flash</b>. Just <b>Q</b> + <b>E</b> and during the last frames of animation, you can <b>Flash</b> into enemy knocking them up.",
      "Combo #2: If you have enough Ability Haste, you can put <b>E</b>, wait and <b>Q</b> to it and cast second <b>E</b> hitting your target. This is especially cool with AP builds. So you can cast <b>E</b> while sliding to existing <b>E</b>."
    ],
    "tricks champion riot": [
      "You can use the Dragon Strike / Demacian Standard combo to get out of your own Cataclysm arenas.",
      "Split your basic attacks on different champions at the beginning of fights to maximize damage.",
      "Use Demacian Standard as a scouting tool when worried about incoming enemies."

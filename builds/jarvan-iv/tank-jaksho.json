      "You start with <b>Guardian's Horn</b>. Your #1 rush should be item that counters enemy team most (MR or Armor item). Get <b>Jak'Sho</b> as #2 item. Then <b>adapt</b>.",
      "<b>Triumph</b> is better overall (heal + gold), but if you want to have easier time with your mana, go Presence of the Mind.",
      "<b>Guardian's Horn</b> is a surprisingly good item for its price. You can keep it for very long time (or even have it as 6th item).",
      "You need to <b>adapt</b> your items to the game. Enemy team heavy on AP? Buy MR. They heavy on AD? Buy Armor. You need some damage? Well buy that.",

      "Combo #1: <b>Q</b> + <b>E</b> + <b>Flash</b>. Just <b>Q</b> + <b>E</b> and during the last frames of animation, you can <b>Flash</b> into enemy knocking them up.",
      "Combo #2: If you have enough Ability Haste, you can put <b>E</b>, wait and <b>Q</b> to it and cast second <b>E</b> hitting your target. This is especially cool with AP builds. So you can cast <b>E</b> while sliding to existing <b>E</b>."

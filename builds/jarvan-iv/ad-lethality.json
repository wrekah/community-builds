      "<b>Snowball</b> / <b>Mark</b> is a crucial cooldown for playing this build. Do not waste it or even wait to hit the enemy at point-blank range to ensure hit (so you follow them, if they <b>Flash</b>).",
      "If an enemy team is full of tanks or bruisers, rush <b>Serylda's Grudge</b> or even <b>Lord Dominik's Regards</b> early (sometimes even #2). <b>Black Cleaver</b> is also an alternative. The key is to <b>adapt</b> to the enemy team."

      "Combo #1: <b>Q</b> + <b>E</b> + <b>Flash</b>. Just <b>Q</b> + <b>E</b> and during the last frames of animation, you can <b>Flash</b> into enemy knocking them up.",
      "Combo #2: If you have enough Ability Haste, you can put <b>E</b>, wait and <b>Q</b> to it and cast second <b>E</b> hitting your target. This is especially cool with AP builds. So you can cast <b>E</b> while sliding to existing <b>E</b>."

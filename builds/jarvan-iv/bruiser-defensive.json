    "how to play": [
      "As Jarvan IV playing Grasp build - you need ot <b>adapt</b> to an enemy team and to the game! Enemy team heavy on AP? Buy MR. Are they heavy on AD? Buy Armor. You need some damage? Well buy that.",

      "Switch targets often in fights to fully use your <b>Martial Cadence (Passive)</b> for more damage!",
      "Combo #1: <b>Q</b> + <b>E</b> + <b>Flash</b>. Just <b>Q</b> + <b>E</b> and during the last frames of animation, you can <b>Flash</b> into enemy knocking them up.",
      "Combo #2: If you have enough Ability Haste, you can put <b>E</b>, wait and <b>Q</b> to it and cast second <b>E</b> hitting your target. This is especially cool with AP builds. So you can cast <b>E</b> while sliding to existing <b>E</b>."

    "tricks champion riot": [
      "You can use the Dragon Strike / Demacian Standard combo to get out of your own Cataclysm arenas.",
      "Split your basic attacks on different champions at the beginning of fights to maximize damage.",
      "Use Demacian Standard as a scouting tool when worried about incoming enemies."

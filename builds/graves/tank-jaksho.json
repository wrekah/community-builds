      "<b>Triumph</b> is better overall (heal + gold), but if you want to have easier time with your mana, go Presence of the Mind.",
      "<b>Guardian's Horn</b> is a surprisingly good item for its price. You can keep it for very long time (or even have it as 6th item).",
      "You need to <b>adapt</b> your items to the game. Enemy team heavy on AP? Buy MR. They heavy on AD? Buy Armor. You need some damage? Well buy that.",

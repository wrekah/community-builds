    "description": "Thornmail Graves build for ARAM. Counter physical damage, stack Armor or don't play at all!",
    "how it works": [
      "You rush <b>Thornmail</b>.",
      "You go full Armor.",
      "<strong>Hit or miss. Works only if an enemy team is full of physical damage dealers (preferably auto-attackers).</strong>",
      "<strong>If an enemy team is full of mages/AP damage, play regular tank build instead.</strong>"

    "how to play": [
      "How is this <b>Thornmail</b> build for Graves different to regular tank builds? Item order, Armor stacking and countering enemy physical damage dealers!",
      "This build is aimed to counter AD comps. Since you don't know the enemy team, you need to <b>adapt</b> in game. It is hit or miss. If they are heavy AP - just play regular tank.",
      "Late game, you can consider selling boots for 6th item - for even more sweet <b>Thornmail</b> damage!",
      "Remember to consume your <b>Grasp of the Undying</b> procs!"
    ],
    "how to play champion": [
      "You get extra spikey by using Quickdraw (<b>E</b>), thanks to increased Armor (it gives double stacks if you <b>E</b> into enemy direction). So do it!"
    ],
    "tricks champion": [
      "You do more damage the closer you are to your target.",
      "Use auto attack reset (AA + <b>Quickdraw (E)</b> + AA). If you time it properly, you can have two almost instant AA for big burst damage.",
      "Combo for big damage: AA + <b>Q</b> + <b>E</b> + AA."
    ],
    "tricks champion riot": [
      "Smoke Screen can be used both to escape and to set up a kill.",
      "Using Quickdraw to get into range and delivering a point blank Buckshot can do lots of damage."

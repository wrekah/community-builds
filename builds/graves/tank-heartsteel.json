      "Sundered Sky is very good damage item for this build (as #2-#4 depending on the game). It scales off your HP (so Grasp, <b>Heartsteel</b>, Overgrowth). It gives damage and pretty good sustain in fights. Remember to switch targets to maximize the effect!",
      "<b>Guardian's Horn</b> is a surprisingly good item for its price. You can keep it for a very long time (or even have it as 6th item).",
      "xxx Runes",
      "<b>Second Wind</b> scales off with your HP, so it is going to be powerful sustain rune. You can use it by purposefully triggering it by letting enemies poke you a little or walking over some harmful spells.",

      "You can prioritize switching between champions in the fight, just to farm more <b>Heartsteel</b> procs.",

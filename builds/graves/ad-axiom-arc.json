    "description": "You are gonna be doing one thing and one thing only... ultin' enemies.",
    "how it works": [
      "This is a specialization of regular <b>Lethality</b> Graves build that is all about big ults and ulting very often, thanks to <b>Axiom Arc</b>.",
      "You build <b>Attack Damage</b> and <b>Lethality</b> to boost damage from your abilities.",
      "You rush <b>Axiom Arc</b> to reduce cooldown of your ultimate, so you can use it more often.",
      "You try to make the most of your <b>First Strike</b> procs to earn gold and deal damage.",
      "The easier version of this build is to take <b>Dark Harvest</b> instead of <b>First Strike</b>."
    ],
    "how to play": [
      "Build <b>Axiom Arc</b> first, then follow up with <b>Lethality</b> and AD items.",
      "If you have mana problems, buy <b>Tear of the Goddess</b>. That should be enough to go through early and mid game. You can sell it later or buy <b>Muramana</b>.",
      "It is okay to not buy boots, or to sell them in the late game. Use 6th slot for more <b>Lethality</b>! You are covered with <b>Ghost</b>.",
      "Since 14.1 Boots become even more optional, since you can get Youmuu's Ghostblade!",
      "Wait for <b>First Strike</b> and proc it with your combo, to deal damage and earn gold.",
      "Be careful to not get poked, because you waste <b>First Strike</b> procs."
    ],
    "how to play champion": [
      "Your usual money-making combo is <b>First Strike</b> + <b>E</b>, followed by <b>Q</b> + <b>R</b> with auto attacks if possible.",
      "Your alternate combo just for poke is <b>First Strike</b> + <b>Q</b> + <b>W</b> + auto attacks if possible."
    ],
    "tricks champion": [
      "You do more damage the closer you are to your target.",
      "Use auto attack reset (AA + <b>Quickdraw (E)</b> + AA). If you time it properly, you can have two almost instant AA for big burst damage.",
      "Combo for big damage: AA + <b>Q</b> + <b>E</b> + AA."
    ],
    "tricks champion riot": [
      "Smoke Screen can be used both to escape and to set up a kill.",
      "Using Quickdraw to get into range and delivering a point blank Buckshot can do lots of damage."

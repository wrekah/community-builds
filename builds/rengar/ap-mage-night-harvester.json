      "Play this build like you would play any Assassin. You are going to be squishy. Do not jump in fights right away, you need to find good timing to unleash your combo.",
      "Damage is a bit lower than AD for single targets, but excels in AOE damage, aka damaging multiple squishies.",
      "The killing things combo is (jump) Q - E (midair) - W - W (on landing, cast is instant if its normal > empowered. empowered > normal has a delay) wait with the second W if there's CC flying at you.",
      "Your favorite spot is going to be bushes. Try securing this spot for you and for your team."

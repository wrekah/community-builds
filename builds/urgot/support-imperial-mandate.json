    "description": "Imperial Mandate Urgot build for ARAM that's all about slowing and disrupting fights.",
    "how it works": [
      "This build is all about <b>Imperial Mandate</b>.",
      "And also all about slows.",
      "You support through disrupting fights, being annoying, Slowing/Healing/Buffing and soaking damage."
    ],
    "how to play": [
      "You rush <b>Rylai's Crystal Scepter</b>, then <b>Imperial Mandate</b>.",
      "Your slows trigger <b>Font of Life</b> AND <b>Imperial Mandate</b>, healing and buffing your allies.",
      "Remember that you need to keep close to your allies to trigger <b>Guardian</b>.",
      "Since LoL Patch 14.1 <b>Imperial Mandate</b> is changed. Now you need your team to proc it to deal any damage. So you need to play a little bit differently. Do not spam mindlessly. Try coordinating it with your team - when they are about to poke or when they go in.",
      "<b>Font of Life</b> heal can trigger various support items, like <b>Ardent Censer</b> or <b>Staff of Flowing Water</b> or even <b>Moonstone Renewer</b>!",
      "You need to <b>adapt</b> your items to the game. Enemy team heavy on AP? Buy MR. They heavy on AD? Buy Armor. You need some damage? Well buy that."
    ],
    "how it works champion": [
      "This build is about applying AOE slow constantly with <b>W</b> + Passive + <b>Rylai's Crystal Scepter</b> (more universal option). You can even get <b>Serylda's Grudge</b> and <b>Iceborn Gauntlet</b> for more consistency. It is all about proccing <b>Imperial Mandate</b> and <b>Font of Life</b> - dealing damage, buffing your allies and healing them."
    ],
    "how to play champion": [
      "Another good rune is <b>Grasp of the Undying</b>."
    ],
    "tricks champion": [
      "<b>R</b> + <b>Flash</b> combo: After you hit <b>Fear Beyond Death (R)</b>, you can <b>R</b> into enemy team for AoE Fear. The crucial aspect of this combo is timing: <b>Flash</b> into an enemy team at the very end of animation, this way they cannot react."
    ],
    "tricks champion riot": [
      "Pay attention to your individual leg's cooldowns, as they make for a signficiant portion of your damage",
      "Land Corrosive Charge or Disdain to lock on to target's with Purge - a great way to trigger multiple legs in rapid succession.",
      "Save Fear Beyond Death for opponents you know are already too weak to survive. It's especially good for picking off fleeing foes."

    "description": "Navori Urgot build. You, one item, being tanky and tons of fun.",
    "how it works": [
      "You rush <b>Navori Flickerblade</b> first.",
      "Then you go <b>full tank</b>.",
      "Thanks to <b>Navori Flickerblade</b>, you are gonna use your abilities often."
    ],
    "how to play": [
      "This is variation of regular Urgot tank build. Difference is <b>Navori Flickerblade</b>, which introduces basic ability cooldown reduction, so you use your abilities more frequent.",
      "You start with <b>Guardian's Horn</b> and <b>Tear of the Goddess</b>, which you will build into <b>Fimbulwinter</b> as #2 item. This way you offset Navori rush.",
      "You rush #1 <b>Navori Flickerblade</b>, #2 <b>Fimbulwinter</b>.",
      "Good #3 item is <b>Spirit Visage</b>, as it boosts your shields and healing.",
      "You will be more tanky later on, so play more carefully in the early game. Especially after rushing #1 item.",
      "<b>Guardian's Horn</b> is a surprisingly good item for its price. You can keep it for very long time (or even have it as 6th item).",
      "You need to <b>adapt</b> your items to the game. Enemy team heavy on AP? Buy MR. They heavy on AD? Buy Armor. You need some damage? Well buy that.",
      "Remember to consume your <b>Grasp of the Undying</b> procs!"
    ],
    "how it works champion": [
      "You can use Disdain (<b>E</b>) every ~4 seconds (if you keep auto attacking with Purge (<b>W</b>) whole time)!",
      "Urgot has special interaction with <b>Navori Flickerblade</b> and Purge (<b>W</b>) - it shots 3 times per second, providing a lot of basic ability cooldown reduction.",
      "This build is all about frequent shields and CC from Disdain (<b>E</b>) from <b>Navori Flickerblade</b>. But to do that, you need to be alive and tanky!",
      "<strong>Simple explanation</strong><br>With a base cooldown of 14 seconds at max rank and 25 Ability Haste (from items like <b>Fimbulwinter</b> and <b>Spirit Visage</b> ), your base cooldown is reduced to 11.2 seconds. Since you attack 3 times per second and each attack reduces the remaining cooldown by 15%, your ability will be ready in about 4 seconds, as both natural cooldown reduction (1 second per second) and attack-based reductions stack together efficiently.",
      "<p><strong>Longer explanation:</strong><br>Remaining cooldown after t seconds can be expressed like this:\n<br><strong>f(t)=(((f(t-1)\u00d70.85\u22120.33)\u00d70.85\u22120.33)\u00d70.85\u22120.33)</strong><br> and for t=1 like this <br><strong>f(1)=(((cooldown\u00d70.85\u22120.33)\u00d70.85\u22120.33)\u00d70.85\u22120.33)</strong><br> <br>\nWhere:<ul><li><strong>cooldown:</strong> The initial cooldown (ability haste included).</li><li><strong>f(t):</strong> The remaining cooldown at time t, calculated recursively.</li><li><strong>0.85:</strong> <b>Navori Flickerblade</b> reduction %.</li><li><strong>0.33:</strong> Urgot attacks 3 times per second, so every 0.33 sec. </li></ul></p><p><strong>Math:</strong><br>Starting with an effective cooldown of 11.2 seconds:</p><ul><li>At <strong>t = 1 second:</strong><br>f(1) = (((11.2\u00d70.85\u22120.33)\u00d70.85\u22120.33)\u00d70.85\u22120.33) = <strong>6.03 seconds remaining.</strong></li><li>At <strong>t = 2 seconds:</strong><br>f(2) = (((6.03\u00d70.85\u22120.33)\u00d70.85\u22120.33)\u00d70.85\u22120.33) = <strong>2.85 seconds remaining.</strong></li><li>At <strong>t = 3 seconds:</strong><br>f(3) = (((2.85\u00d70.85\u22120.33)\u00d70.85\u22120.33)\u00d70.85\u22120.33) = <strong>0.90 seconds remaining.</strong></li><li>At <strong>t = 4 seconds:</strong><br>f(4) = (((0.90\u00d70.85\u22120.33)\u00d70.85\u22120.33)\u00d70.85\u22120.33) = <strong>-0.29 seconds remaining (so effectively 0).</strong></li></ul>\n"

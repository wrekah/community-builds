    "description": "Titanic Hydra Annie build. You, Annie, Grasp of the Undying and one very specific item. Hail Hydra!",
    "how it works": [
      "You play Bruiser stacking HP, auto attacking and rushing one specific item. You <b>adapt</b> to enemy team, building tanky items.",
      "You rush <b>Titanic Hydra</b>.",
      "<b>Titanic Hydra</b> can be your only damage item. Then go <b>full tank</b>.",
      "Your auto attacks are quite powerful, thanks to <b>Titanic Hydra</b> and <b>Grasp of the Undying</b>. It's your main source of damage + your abilities."
    ],
    "how to play": [
      "This build is focused on a single item - <b>Titanic Hydra</b>.",
      "How is this build different to other bruisers builds? The main difference is item rush order. You rush <b>Titanic Hydra</b> first, then <b>adapt</b> to the situation!",
      "If you want to go more damage, Sundered Sky is an excellent damage item for this build. It scales off your HP (so with Grasp, Overgrowth). It gives damage and pretty good sustain in fights. Remember to switch targets to maximize the effect!",
      "A very effective way of poking enemies is to use <b>Titanic Hydra</b> Active and hit minions in front of them (closer to them, better the effect).",
      "Another effective way of poking enemies with Titanic, is to hit caster minions in the back.",
      "Enemy team heavy on AP? Buy MR. They heavy on AD? Buy Armor. You need some damage? Well buy that.",
      "Remember to consume your <b>Grasp of the Undying</b> procs!"
    ],
    "how to play champion": [
      "Annie has a massive auto attack range. Use this with <b>Titanic Hydra</b> Active to poke from very far."
    ],
    "tricks champion": [
      "Keep track of the stacks of your <b>Pyromania (Passive)</b>!",
      "<b>Disintegrate (Q)</b> has travel time, <b>Incinerate (W)</b> is as instant cast, and <b>Summon: Tibbers (R)</b> is a targeted ability. It means that instant stun that they cannot dodge or site step is <b>W</b>.",
      "If you are not sure if you will land Tibbers, use <b>Q</b> first to stun them, then use <b>R</b>.",
      "If you hit somebody with <b>Mark</b> (<b>Snowball</b>) and you go in, it is very telegraphed action. Opponents will expect you to use Tibbers right off. So they will use <b>Flash</b> as soon as you get to them. In such cases, it is better to stun them with <b>Q</b> or <b>W</b>. Followed by Tibbers to destroy them, while they are stunned.",
      "Preparing to engage? Stack your <b>Pyromania (Passive)</b> with <b>Incinerate (W)</b> and <b>Molten Shield (E)</b>.",
      "If you want to catch somebody off guard or have better engage, use <b>Molten Shield (E)</b> on yourself for Movement Speed buff beforehand.",
      "Annie combo #1: you can stun somebody with <b>Disintegrate (Q)</b> with 3 stacks! It has travel time, so during that you can use <b>W</b> or <b>E</b> to get full stacks and <b>Q</b> will still stun them.",
      "Do not be shy and do not wait for 'special moment'. You have good engaging and catching tool - AoE stun with <b>R</b>. Paired with movement speed buff from <b>E</b> + <b>Flash</b> it is a certain AoE stun and often won fight."
    ],
    "tricks champion riot": [
      "Storing a stun for use with her ultimate can turn the tide of a team fight.",
      "Striking killing blows on minions with Disintegrate enables Annie to farm extremely well early in the game.",
      "Molten Shield is a good spell to cast to work up to Annie's stun, so sometimes it's beneficial to grab at least 1 rank in it early."

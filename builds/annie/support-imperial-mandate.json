    "description": "Imperial Mandate Annie build for ARAM that's all about slowing and disrupting fights.",
    "how it works": [
      "This build is all about <b>Imperial Mandate</b>.",
      "And also all about slows.",
      "You support through disrupting fights, being annoying, Slowing/Healing/Buffing and soaking damage."
    ],
    "how to play": [
      "You rush <b>Rylai's Crystal Scepter</b>, then <b>Imperial Mandate</b>.",
      "Your CC triggers Glacial Augument that slows AOE. All Slows trigger <b>Font of Life</b> AND <b>Imperial Mandate</b>, healing and buffing your allies.",
      "Since LoL Patch 14.1 <b>Imperial Mandate</b> is changed. Now you need your team to proc it to deal any damage. So you need to play a little bit differently. Do not spam mindlessly. Try coordinating it with your team - when they are about to poke or when they go in.",
      "<b>Font of Life</b> heal can trigger various support items, like <b>Ardent Censer</b> or <b>Staff of Flowing Water</b> or even <b>Moonstone Renewer</b>!",
      "You need to <b>adapt</b> your items to the game. Enemy team heavy on AP? Buy MR. They heavy on AD? Buy Armor. You need some damage? Well buy that."
    ],
    "tricks champion": [
      "Keep track of the stacks of your <b>Pyromania (Passive)</b>!",
      "<b>Disintegrate (Q)</b> has travel time, <b>Incinerate (W)</b> is as instant cast, and <b>Summon: Tibbers (R)</b> is a targeted ability. It means that instant stun that they cannot dodge or site step is <b>W</b>.",
      "If you are not sure if you will land Tibbers, use <b>Q</b> first to stun them, then use <b>R</b>.",
      "If you hit somebody with <b>Mark</b> (<b>Snowball</b>) and you go in, it is very telegraphed action. Opponents will expect you to use Tibbers right off. So they will use <b>Flash</b> as soon as you get to them. In such cases, it is better to stun them with <b>Q</b> or <b>W</b>. Followed by Tibbers to destroy them, while they are stunned.",
      "Preparing to engage? Stack your <b>Pyromania (Passive)</b> with <b>Incinerate (W)</b> and <b>Molten Shield (E)</b>.",
      "If you want to catch somebody off guard or have better engage, use <b>Molten Shield (E)</b> on yourself for Movement Speed buff beforehand.",
      "Annie combo #1: you can stun somebody with <b>Disintegrate (Q)</b> with 3 stacks! It has travel time, so during that you can use <b>W</b> or <b>E</b> to get full stacks and <b>Q</b> will still stun them.",
      "Do not be shy and do not wait for 'special moment'. You have good engaging and catching tool - AoE stun with <b>R</b>. Paired with movement speed buff from <b>E</b> + <b>Flash</b> it is a certain AoE stun and often won fight."
    ],
    "tricks champion riot": [
      "Storing a stun for use with her ultimate can turn the tide of a team fight.",
      "Striking killing blows on minions with Disintegrate enables Annie to farm extremely well early in the game.",
      "Molten Shield is a good spell to cast to work up to Annie's stun, so sometimes it's beneficial to grab at least 1 rank in it early."

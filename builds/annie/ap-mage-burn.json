      "You play as Mage building Burn items.",
      "You rush <b>Liandry's Torment</b>.",
      "You burn your enemies. With DOTs. And debuffs."
    ],
    "how to play": [
      "Playing AP Burn Annie build, your default rush is <b>Liandry's Torment</b> vs. HP, Blackfire Torch vs. squishes. Then get the other item",
      "Adapt to an enemy team. Are they full of tanks, and they rush tons of Magic Resist? You rush <b>Void Staff</b> as #2 or #3 item to counter MR stacking. Their team has champs with lots of healing? Rush <b>Oblivion Orb</b> as #2 item (upgrade to <b>Morellonomicon</b> as 4th or 5th item).",
      "Items like <b>Morellonomicon</b> or Oblivon Orb are extra effective with this build, thanks to damage over time effects from <b>Liandry's Torment</b>.",
      "In some rare cases, when an enemy team has an extremely strong shielding, you can even buy <b>Serpent's Fang</b>. It works with your DoTs, meaning shield reduction lasts longer.",
      "They have lots of melee? Or you just want to kite them? Get <b>Rylai's Crystal Scepter</b>.",
      "Somebody is going after you each fight? Always getting ulted by enemy assassins? Rush <b>Zhonya's Hourglass</b>.",
      "If you are doing well, are ahead and want to have some fun, you can buy <b>The Collector</b> item. It works off your damage over time effects! "

      "Keep track of the stacks of your <b>Pyromania (Passive)</b>!",
      "<b>Disintegrate (Q)</b> has travel time, <b>Incinerate (W)</b> is as instant cast, and <b>Summon: Tibbers (R)</b> is a targeted ability. It means that instant stun that they cannot dodge or site step is <b>W</b>.",
      "If you are not sure if you will land Tibbers, use <b>Q</b> first to stun them, then use <b>R</b>.",
      "If you hit somebody with <b>Mark</b> (<b>Snowball</b>) and you go in, it is very telegraphed action. Opponents will expect you to use Tibbers right off. So they will use <b>Flash</b> as soon as you get to them. In such cases, it is better to stun them with <b>Q</b> or <b>W</b>. Followed by Tibbers to destroy them, while they are stunned.",
      "Preparing to engage? Stack your <b>Pyromania (Passive)</b> with <b>Incinerate (W)</b> and <b>Molten Shield (E)</b>.",
      "If you want to catch somebody off guard or have better engage, use <b>Molten Shield (E)</b> on yourself for Movement Speed buff beforehand.",
      "Annie combo #1: you can stun somebody with <b>Disintegrate (Q)</b> with 3 stacks! It has travel time, so during that you can use <b>W</b> or <b>E</b> to get full stacks and <b>Q</b> will still stun them.",
      "Do not be shy and do not wait for 'special moment'. You have good engaging and catching tool - AoE stun with <b>R</b>. Paired with movement speed buff from <b>E</b> + <b>Flash</b> it is a certain AoE stun and often won fight."

      "Storing a stun for use with her ultimate can turn the tide of a team fight.",
      "Striking killing blows on minions with Disintegrate enables Annie to farm extremely well early in the game.",
      "Molten Shield is a good spell to cast to work up to Annie's stun, so sometimes it's beneficial to grab at least 1 rank in it early."

    "how to play": [
      "Your first rush is <b>Redemption</b>.",
      "Your second rush can be <b>Locket of the Iron Solari</b> (vs AoE), <b>Moonstone Renewer</b> (sustain).",
      "Also, <b>Echoes of Helia</b> is pretty good because you can proc it consistently with <b>Font of Life</b> (slow/cc).",
      "Rush second Locket if your team already doing teamfights or when an enemy team has champions with super aoe damage (example: like Fiddle's ult). Otherwise, get <b>Moonstone Renewer</b> #2. The third item should be whatever you did not buy - <b>Locket of the Iron Solari</b> or <b>Moonstone Renewer</b>. That's your core.",
      "Another decent item if you have carry/strong bruiser/strong tank is <b>Knight's Vow</b>.",
      "Try to use summoner spell <b>Heal</b> on cooldown. With <b>Moonstone Renewer</b>, ideally there should be at least two people for maximum healing effect.",
      "Later in the game, for maximum support - you can sell boots for sixth item.",
      "You can get items like <b>Ardent Censer</b> (some auto attackers needed) or <b>Staff of Flowing Water</b>. It will be triggered often enough that it will be worth.",
      "Interesting item is <b>Cryptbloom</b>. If you want to go full healing, you can get it like #4+ item.",

      "<b>Shurelya's Battlesong</b> has 68.12 sec cooldown (down from 75 sec).",
      "</NESTED>",
      "<b>Guardian</b> is important rune. It is going to provide tons of shielding. Remember that you need to be close to your allies to proc it.",

      "You can also manipulate it - for example, you can stick to one ally, or avoid some spells that's gonna only waste it.",
      "</NESTED>",
      "You will be triggering <b>Font of Life</b> effect, which will heal your allies. It also chains off <b>Moonstone Renewer</b>!",
      "<b>Font of Life</b> total healing is not properly calculated in a post-game lobby. Value is bigger in the game vs. what's displayed in statistics. You heal more!",
      "Another important rule is <b>Cosmic Insight</b>, it reduces cooldown for your active items (so more heals/shielding) and <b>Heal</b> summoner spell.",
      "xxx <b>Redemption</b>",
      "Try to use <b>Redemption</b> on cooldown, when your allies are missing some health. It is best to use when they are grouped. Especially if you already have <b>Moonstone Renewer</b>, it is best to wait (or ping) until they group together, so you can have them all healed.",
      "Remember that you can use <b>Redemption</b> for the damage. However, in general, it is not worth it. Keep it to heal your team!",
      "Be careful when using <b>Redemption</b> while you are dead, and you are about to be respawned. The camera will go to your position, and you can cast it in the spawning pool by mistake. Watch out for bad timing!"

      "You can use <b>Umbral Dash (E)</b> for short dash, this way animation lasts shorter, and you can get crucial milliseconds to auto attack faster (can be deciding a factor in 1v1).",

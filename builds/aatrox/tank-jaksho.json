    "description": "Tank Aatrox ARAM build with Jak'Sho. Get tanky and adapt to enemy team!",
    "how to play": [
      "You start with <b>Guardian's Horn</b>. Your #1 rush should be item that counters enemy team most (MR or Armor item). Get <b>Jak'Sho</b> as #2 item. Then <b>adapt</b>.",
      "<b>Guardian's Horn</b> is a surprisingly good item for its price. You can keep it for very long time (or even have it as 6th item).",
      "You need to <b>adapt</b> your items to the game. Enemy team heavy on AP? Buy MR. They heavy on AD? Buy Armor. You need some damage? Well buy that.",
      "Remember to consume your <b>Grasp of the Undying</b> procs!"
    ],
    "how to play champion": [
      "Tank Aatrox is a very different take on regular Aatrox Bruiser build. Instead of focusing on maxing <b>Q</b>, going AD and casting abilities, you are gonna be tanky and mainly auto-attacking, consuming <b>Grasp of the Undying</b> procs and making use of item procs.",
      "As Tank Aatrox, you go in, soak damage, disrupt fights and do a lot of auto attacking.",
      "You can optionally max <b>Q</b> first, if an enemy team has a lot of ranged/poke champs and you cannot go toe to toe.",
      "Your <b>E</b> <b>resets</b> your auto attack!"
    ],
    "tricks champion": [
      "<b>Q</b> + <b>Flash</b> combos: You can use <b>Flash</b> during any time of <b>The Darkin Blade (Q)</b> animations. You can even combine that with <b>Umbral Dash (E)</b>. You can <b>Flash</b> and <b>Umbral Dash (E)</b> in any direction, making very spectacular and flashy plays.",
      "You can use <b>Umbral Dash (E)</b> for short dash, this way animation lasts shorter, and you can get crucial milliseconds to auto attack faster (can be deciding a factor in 1v1).",
      "You can reset your auto attack timer with <b>Umbral Dash (E)</b>. It might be crucial in duels, or when pushing enemy turrets."
    ],
    "tricks champion riot": [
      "Use Umbral Dash while casting The Darkin Blade to increase your chances of hitting the enemy.",
      "Crowd Control abilities like Infernal Chains or your allies' immobilizing effects will help you set up The Darkin Blade.",
      "Cast World Ender when you are sure you can force a fight."

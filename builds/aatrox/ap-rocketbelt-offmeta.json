    "description": "Unconventional and very fun AP Aatrox build that is focused around this very specific item and rune.",
    "how it works": [
      "You rush <b>Hextech Rocketbelt</b> #1, <b>Liandry's Torment</b> #2.",
      "You get <b>Cosmic Insight</b> rune to use <b>Hextech Rocketbelt</b> more often.",
      "You poke with <b>Hextech Rocketbelt</b> and <b>First Strike</b> to earn gold and burn enemies.",
      "After core items, you <b>adapt</b>. You can play as a tank or as a damage dealer."
    ],
    "how to play": [
      "Use <b>Hextech Rocketbelt</b> active to poke your enemies all the time, earning gold with <b>First Strike</b>.",
      "Adapt to the enemy team. Build tanky or more damage. You can play as a utility tank, poke, or even you can go some AD items to still have plenty of damage. Depends on the team and how you want to play.",
      "For utility tank, remember that <b>Liandry's Torment</b> works good with <b>Serpent's Fang</b> (to counter shields) and <b>Oblivion Orb</b> (to counter healing).",
      "<b>Cosmic Insight</b> reduces the cooldown of all active items, so <b>Zhonya's Hourglass</b> really works well with this build.",
      "Wait for the <b>First Strike</b> and proc it with your combo, to deal damage and earn gold.",
      "Be careful to not get poked, because you waste <b>First Strike</b> procs."
    ],
    "how to play champion": [
      "Your main money-making combo is <b>First Strike</b> + <b>Hextech Rocketbelt</b> + following that up with Qs + <b>E</b>.",
      "Your alternate combo just for poke is <b>E</b>, then <b>First Strike</b> + <b>Hextech Rocketbelt</b>."
    ],
    "tricks champion": [
      "<b>Q</b> + <b>Flash</b> combos: You can use <b>Flash</b> during any time of <b>The Darkin Blade (Q)</b> animations. You can even combine that with <b>Umbral Dash (E)</b>. You can <b>Flash</b> and <b>Umbral Dash (E)</b> in any direction, making very spectacular and flashy plays.",
      "You can use <b>Umbral Dash (E)</b> for short dash, this way animation lasts shorter, and you can get crucial milliseconds to auto attack faster (can be deciding a factor in 1v1).",
      "You can reset your auto attack timer with <b>Umbral Dash (E)</b>. It might be crucial in duels, or when pushing enemy turrets."
    ],
    "tricks champion riot": [
      "Use Umbral Dash while casting The Darkin Blade to increase your chances of hitting the enemy.",
      "Crowd Control abilities like Infernal Chains or your allies' immobilizing effects will help you set up The Darkin Blade.",
      "Cast World Ender when you are sure you can force a fight."
